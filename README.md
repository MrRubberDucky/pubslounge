# So no one complains.
Random powershell, batch and bash scripts I've made for this specific Discord server. Mostly utility/helper scripts to download something that's big, also some simple automation.

Just them being here doesn't mean they're actively being used, always looking for a better, less involved method to accomplish something. They usually follow same philosophies I have with bash scripts where privilege escalation is only needed in rare cases (like installing a program with `winget`)
